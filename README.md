# ML_CA2 – Income Prediction and Sentiment Analysis

This project is divided into two main parts. The first part focuses on predicting customer income using structured banking data. The second part performs sentiment analysis on textual data to classify emotional tone using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

##  Project Objectives

###  Part 1: Income Prediction
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer demographic and financial data
- Handle missing values and detect duplicate records
- Encode categorical variables
- Train a **Neural Network model** to predict customer income
- Evaluate model performance using regression metrics

###  Part 2: Sentiment Analysis
- Preprocess and clean raw textual data
- Perform sentiment classification using **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- Classify tweets or comments into **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**
- Visualize sentiment distribution and highlight common word patterns

---

##  Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning (handling nulls, duplicates)
- Feature Engineering (categorical encoding, type handling)
- Neural Network modeling
- Sentiment classification using VADER
- Data visualization using matplotlib/seaborn
